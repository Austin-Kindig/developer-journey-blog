        <h1>The Roadmap</h1>
            <p>My goal is lofty, but I think doable. I want to be putting out applications to different firms starting August 17th(my 29th birthday)!</p>
            <h2>August</h2>
                <h3>Main Goal: Have My First Application Out - 8/17 </h3>
                <p>
                    During this month I will continue working on making new projects and hopefully some other things. (unknown-unknowns)
                    I think that as long as I have one application out by my birthday and I send out several a week I will call it a success.
                </p>
            <h2>July</h2>
                <h3>Main Goal: Finish Four Large Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    I'll make a set of smaller goals as time gets closer and I have a better idea of where I'm at and what I can do.
                </p>
            <h2>June</h2>
                <h3>Main Goal: Finish the Full Stack Javascript Track on The Odin Project</h3>
                <p>
                    This will most likey be the harded month of them all. In an academic sense it will be the most demanding of my time:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Intermediate HTML and CSS (TOP)</li>
                        <li>Javascript (TOP)</li>
                        <li>Advanced HTML and CSS (TOP)</li>
                        <li>Node.js (TOP)</li>
                        <li>Getting Hired (TOP)</li>
                        <li>Complete HarvardX CS50</li>
                        <li>Go to a local programming meetup</li>
                        <li>Have a social media prescence</li>
                        <li>Begin work on my first large project</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    Besides the demands of the practice and study this year, I am anxious about the vulnerability of talking to real, live people about programming/my code.
                </p>
            <h2>May</h2>
                <h3>Main Goal: Finish the Foundations Track on The Odin Project</h3>
                <p>
                    during this month I want to have completed:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Javascript Basics (TOP)</li>
                        <li>The Back End (TOP)</li>
                        <li>Conclusion (TOP)</li>

                        <li>Complete this website (HTML and CSS)</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>I don't know if I can read two books along with all these other resources, but if they take me longer than that's alright.</p>
